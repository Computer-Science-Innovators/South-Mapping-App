# South-Mapping-App
An app to map South that will be known as Smaps (South Maps)


## Inspiration
Our school, WWP South has an almost priso-like layout. To help newcomers to the school, we made this app.

## What it does
Our app shows students how to get around the school

## How We built it
We built the app with Unity, scripted with C#. We utilized Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest walkable path between rooms in the school.

## Challenges We ran into


## Accomplishments that We are proud of


## What We learned
We learned about how to use the game design engine Unity along with how to code in C#, as most of us are used to Java, the programming language taught in our school.

## What's next for smaps
Stay tuned for a potential geolocation update
