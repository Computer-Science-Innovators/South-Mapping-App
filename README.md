# South-Mapping-App
An app to map South that will be known as Smaps (South Maps)


## Why Did We Make This App?
Our school, WWP South has an almost prison-like layout. To help newcomers to the school, we made this app, and also to help save time for people who may be in a rush.

## What Does It Do?
Our app shows students how to get around the school with the shortest possible path between two classrooms, given the layout of the school. 

## How Did We Build This App?
We built the app with Unity, scripted with C#. We utilized Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest walkable path between rooms in the school.

## Challenges
Djikstra's algorithm itself was easy to comprehend, but the implementation of the formula into our code was much more difficult than previously anticipated. 

## Accomplishments
This app works well for our school, and we plan on implementing it with other layouts in the future. We hope to grow this app into a pathfinder for any inputted map. 

## What We Learned
We learned about how to use the game design engine Unity along with how to code in C#, as most of us are used to Java, the programming language taught in our school.

## What Are Our Future Plans?
We plan on making this app easier to use and being able to work from an inputted map, making traveling much easier for users.
